The dependent Variable is Exited which we will use to observe the outcome while the independent variables are the other columns which will enable us to get an outcome. 

The Models were build using ANN and Logistic Regression to compare the outcomes after carrying out a predeiction for a customer details feed to the model.Logistic Regression was the model that we deployed on the web through flask this allowed a user to key in info that was feed to the model then a prediction would be carrried out and an outcome given
