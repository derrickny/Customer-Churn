The dependent Variable is Exited which we will use to observe the outcome while the independent variables are the other columns which will enable us to get an outcome.

The Models were built using ANN and Logistic Regression to compare the outcomes after carrying out a prediction for a customer details fed to the model.Logistic Regression was the model that we deployed on the web through flask this allowed a user to key in info that was fed to the model then a prediction would be carried out and an outcome given
